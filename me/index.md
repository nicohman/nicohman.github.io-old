My name is Nico Hickman, or usually nicohman online. I am a programmer, proficent mostly in javascript(both client-side with jQuery and server-side with NodeJS), and Rust. I also have capabilities with C++ and Python, though I use those less. I've used MongoDB for most server-side data-storage. You can find my github [here](https://github.com/nicohman), where almost all of my projects are stored. If you want to contact me, there's a few different ways:
	- If it's a bug or feature request to do with a specific project, file an issue in the relevant Github repo
	- If you want to talk to me personally about something, you can [email](mailto:nico.hickman@gmail.com) me
	- Otherwise, you can find me on mastodon at [@nicohman@cybre.space](cybre.space/@nicohman).

Thanks for checking out my website!
