# raven

[raven](https://git.sr.ht/~nicohman/raven) is a rust-based theme manager for linux desktops. It works by defining multiple different 'options', like a polybar configuration, or a wallpaper, and then loads them into sequence when asked to. Even if you're not using a full-on DE, and instead opting for the more minimal WM like i3 or bspwm, you can still get a coherent theme that affects pretty much everything you do. There's a complete list of options available in the README. If you want to use it, you can install it at [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/raventhemer) under the name raventhemer. Until recently, it wasn't a particularly difficult project, but I recently implemented an online package system for people to share their themes, which is where it got more complicated. You can learn about the server itself [here](https://nicohman.github.io/20180824/ravenserver), and raven uses the [reqwest](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest) crate to talk to the server. You can, of course, configure raven by editing config.json in ~/.config/raven. Here's a quick overview of the config options:
- menu\_command: This is a string that will be executed as a command in bash when raven menu. It will be passed a new-line separated list of theme names via STDIN, and then expects a theme name from STDOUT. By default, this is a [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi) command

- monitors: This is a number that determines how many instances of polybar to spawn when a theme is loaded - one for each monitor

- polybar: An array of strings, that in order give the names of polybar bars to be run for each monitor. Because of how polybar is set up, these have to be different for each bar/monitor

- last: This is just the last theme that you loaded with raven

- editing: And the theme you are currently editing with raven

- host: This is a string representing which ThemeHub host raven should use. The default is "[https://demenses.net](https://demenses.net)"
