# hello, world

Well, I finally bit the bullet and made a personal webpage. Congratulations to myself, I guess. If you're looking for info on me, I've got an [about page](https://nicohman.github.io/me). If you're looking for info on a specific project, you should check the project tag, where I do writeups on each of my major projects. And if you're wondering how to pronounce the site name, ` is grave.
