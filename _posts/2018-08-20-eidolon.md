# Eidolon

[Eidolon](https://github.com/nicohman/eidolon) is a CLI game manager and launcher for linux. It's also my most popular project by far. You can install it from [crates.io](https://crates.io/eidolon), or from an unofficial package maintained on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/eidolon). It's coded in Rust, and aims to consolidate of all games you could have installed into one pretty-looking, extremely customizable and minimalist experience. It supports automatic importing of games from several sources, and uses rofi by default to let the user choose a game to run. Basic usage is covered on the github, so go there if you want to just use it. It supports several different platforms from which it can automatically import games:

- Steam
- Lutris(wine only, to minimize crossover with other platforms)
- Itch.io client

All steam libraries must be defined  in the config file to be scanned, but the other sources will work no matter where you're keeping your games. There isn't much that's particularly difficult about it technically -- and a few parts of its design I particularly regret -- But parsing steam's .vdf files takes more than a few bizarre regexes. There's a couple of config options that I'll go over here:

- menu\_command: A string command that will be passed a new-line separated list of game names via STDIN, and expects a game name from STDOUT.  Basically, the same deal as [raven](https://github.com/nicohman/raven). This also uses [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi) by default.

- steam\_dirs: An array of steam library directories to be scanned automatically

- prefix\_command: A string to prefix running every game with. Useful with NVIDIA's bumblebee or other performance-enhancing software.

All of these can be changed in ~/.config/eidolon/config.json.
